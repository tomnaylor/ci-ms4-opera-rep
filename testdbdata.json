          "synopsis":"Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (Italian: [dʒuˈzɛppe ˈverdi]; 9 or 10 October 1813 – 27 January 1901) was an Italian composer best known for his operas. He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means, receiving a musical education with the help of a local patron. Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Vincenzo Bellini, whose works significantly influenced him.\r\n\r\nIn his early operas, Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy. He also participated briefly as an elected politician. The chorus \"Va, pensiero\" from his early opera Nabucco (1842), and similar choruses in later operas, were much in the spirit of the unification movement, and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals. An intensely private person, Verdi did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements. As he became professionally successful he was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region. He surprised the musical world by returning, after his success with the opera Aida (1871), with three late masterpieces: his Requiem (1874), and the operas Otello (1887) and Falstaff (1893).\r\n\r\nHis operas remain extremely popular, especially the three peaks of his 'middle period': Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata. The bicentenary of his birth in 2013 was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances.",

          "synopsis":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart[a] (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart,[b] was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is among the greatest composers in the history of Western music,[1] with music admired for its \"melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture\".[2]\r\n\r\nBorn in Salzburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. His father took him on a grand tour of Europe and then three trips to Italy. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death are largely uncertain and have thus been much mythologized.",

          "synopsis":"Wedding preparations are underway for Lieutenant Pinkerton of the United States Navy, who has taken out a ‘999-year’ lease on a house. Anticipating the arrival of his young bride-to-be, known as Madam Butterfly, Pinkerton is reassured by the ‘marriage-broker’ Goro that both the lease and the marriage contract have convenient exit clauses. He breezily shares his world view over a pre-wedding drink with his compatriot the American Consul Sharpless, who is concerned that the girl Butterfly recently visited the American Consulate and appears to be taking the marriage seriously. His advice to proceed with caution goes unheeded by the infatuated Pinkerton.\r\n\r\nButterfly (Cio Cio San) arrives, surrounded by friends and relations, eager to meet her new husband. She candidly reveals to Pinkerton and Sharpless the facts of her life so far. Her family has lost everything. Her father had committed suicide, so she entertains as a ‘hostess’ to support her impoverished mother. She is exactly 15 years old. Privately, Butterfly shares her most treasured possessions with Pinkerton, confessing that, in order to please her husband, she has been secretly adapting to his American way-of-life and beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony takes place with efficiency, but the celebrations are interrupted by the Bonze, Butterfly’s feared uncle, who confronts her about her secret visits to the mission and the American Consulate. Furious, the Bonze publicly condemns Butterfly for betraying her community and culture. Her shocked family and friends, apart from the servant Suzuki, denounce and shun her. Pinkerton comforts the abandoned Butterfly. The newlyweds make love under the stars.\r\n\r\nThree years have passed. Butterfly and Suzuki are still living in Pinkerton’s house and have run out of money. Convinced that Pinkerton will return, Butterfly has turned down several marriage proposals from the wealthy Yamadori.\r\n\r\nSharpless has had a letter from Pinkerton asking him to break the news to Butterfly that he is planning to return, but that Pinkerton does not want to see her.  She refuses to listen. When Sharpless tries to persuade her to accept Yamadori, she says death would be preferable and reveals she has had a son by Pinkerton. Sharpless leaves, promising to let the child’s father know. The harbour cannon is heard, signaling the arrival of Pinkerton’s ship. Her devotion vindicated; Butterfly celebrates with Suzuki before settling down to await his arrival in a night vigil.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Butterfly is still waiting. Suzuki persuades her to sleep as Sharpless returns with Pinkerton and his real American wife, Kate. They ask for Suzuki’s help in breaking the news to Butterfly that they want to adopt the child. Faced with the reality of his actions, Pinkerton gives Sharpless money to pay for the child and leaves.\r\n\r\nButterfly wakes, to be confronted by a stranger who makes her afraid. Comprehending that this woman is Pinkerton’s wife, she agrees to give up her son on condition that Pinkerton comes in person to fetch him. She says goodbye to her young son and, using the weapon her father used before her, she kills herself. Pinkerton returns to find Butterfly’s lifeless body.",

Sharpless, the American consul, breaks the news to her that Pinkerton has returned, but with a new, American wife.\r\n\r\nWhen they hear about the child, Pinkerton and Kate decide that they should adopt him. In despair, knowing that they will be able to look after him better than she can, Butterfly takes a last farewell of her son and kills herself.\r\n\r\nJoachim Herz’s Madam Butterfly has been with us for over three decades and with good reason.

When one of his conquests ends in murder, it looks like his luck is about to turn. He finds himself on the run, pursued by disgruntled ex-lovers, fiancées and a force from beyond the grave. But when he refuses to show remorse, his past catches up with him and leads to his ultimate demise.\r\n\r\nBased on the legend of Don Juan, Welsh National Opera’s production is set during the Spanish Golden Age. Mozart reflects both comedy and tragedy brilliantly in the score, including the ‘Catalogue’ aria detailing Giovanni’s list of 2065 lovers, the sparkling ‘Champagne’ aria and the high drama of the heart-stopping finale.",
