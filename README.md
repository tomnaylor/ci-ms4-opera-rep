* receive secure donations using STRIPE
* make the app easy to navigate and mobile friendly
* create a single app for alll the production news and media
* review reviews before they go live **~TO DO**


### Development Methods
 As the sole developer of the online production catalogue, I have taken an agile approach to the development of the app. I build an early release and then completed user stories as smaller incremental improvements. This method alows me to write the expectations of the sites users, order them, and tackle one at a time. This helps make sure the basic function of the app is running to ship to market as soon as possible.

### Design

#### Wireframes
I used a drawing tool to create a wireframe for the two responsive sizes (desktop and mobile).

![wireframe](readme/wireframe.jpg)


#### Codebase
The frontend will be built using Bootstrap 5.1 for the layouts and styling. The backend will be developed in Python, using the Django framework. The site will consist of a number of apps that will individually handel the models, urls, forms and views for each:
* **home** to manage the homepage
* **works** to manage the productions, media, people
* **profiles** to manage the user profiles, comments and likes
* **donations** to manage the donations


#### Database
I used a postgres DB hosted by Heroku (on AWS) for the production database. I also used a local sqllite3 DB for development and tests. At it's basic function, the app uses a number of tables that mostly share keys so that duplication is avoided. An ERD image is below.

![wireframe](readme/erd.png)

The database has tables across 4 apps: works, profiles, user and donations.

#### Font family
To provide a readable, reliable and fast font library, I have used the "Segoe UI" font that bootstrap comes build with.

#### Colours
I used the build in [colours in bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/color/), taking advantage of the built in styles. Mostly using blues, greens and light greys.

#### Icons
All icons used are from the [fontawesome v5.15.4](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search) library. The Favicon was created using [favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc/)


## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation
I have tried to make a intuitive, accessible and reactive navigation bar that stays useful across different screen sizes and devices. For desktop, the menu sticks to the top of every page with identical layouts. The menu items change depending on if the user is logged in, not logged in or an admin. On mobile the manu is replaced with a hamburger icon and pressing that slides the menu in from the right.

#### Add, Edit and deleting productions, media items, people etc.
This is handeled by the Django admin pages. Django was designed for exactly this kind of use. The admin pages make quick work of setting up a new project and letting you quickly develop the application, using as little custom code to add behind-the-scenes content.

#### Add, Edit and deleting reviews


#### sign up, login and logout
Viewing the content does not need to login, but other sections of the app need a user access / admin rights. Adding, editing and deleting a review and liking a production all need user access. All Django admin pages also need a superuser to access.


### Features left to implement

## Testing

As the testing process was quite extensive, I have included a second readme exclusivley for testing. 

You can **[view the testing readme here](README-TESTS.md)**



## Deployment
The final website has been deployed to Heroku via its free tier. Written in gitpod, after each commit and push, the master branch on GitHub was used to update heroku automatically.

I used the following steps to deploy to Heroku.

* Create Heroku app
    * Login to Heroku and click "Create new app".
    * Give the app a name, select a region and click on create app.
    * Click a add a new add-on and search for Heroku postgress database. Once added take note of the URL path for use later.
* Setup AWS IAM
    * Login to Amazon AWS, search for IAM and click "add user"
    * give the user a username and select access type "programmatic access"
    * Give the group a name and seach for "AmazonS3FullAccess", then click "create group"
    * Take note of teh user, access key and secret access key for later.
* Setup AWS S3 bucket
    * Login to Amazon AWS, search for the S3 service and click "create bucket"
    * Give the bucket a name and select a region
    * Turn off "block all public access" select "ACLs enabled", "Bucket owner prefered" and click "create bucket"
    * Turn on "static website hosting" in the properties tab and fill in the details
    * On the permissions tab paste the CORS configuration found [here](readme/aws-cors-config.txt)
    * In Permissions, select "bucket policy". Type is s3 bucket policy, allow all principal and actions will be "GetObject". ARN is in the bucket policy tab. An example can be [found here](readme/aws-bucket-policy.txt)
* Setup Sendgrid
    * 
    *
* Env config vars in Heroku
    * In Heroku, click on "settings" and then "reveal config vars". You will need to add the following variables:
    * **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** Public access key for Amazon AWS bucket (leave empty to use local storage)
    * **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** Secret access key for Amazon AWS bucket (leave empty to use local storage)
    * **DATABASE_URL** Full URL (inc user, pass, domain) for the postgres database (leave empty to use local sqllite3 DB)
    * **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD** password to connect to SMTP
    * **EMAIL_HOST_USER** username to connect to SMPT
    * **SECRET_KEY** Django app secret key
    * **STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY** Stripe payments public key
    * **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** Stripe payments secret key
    * **STRIPE_WH_SECRET** Stripe payments webhook secret key
* Gitpod
    * Set url for Heroku in the ALLOWED_HOSTS in opera_rep.settings.py ~line 32
    * Create Procfile with "web: gunicorn opera_rep.wsgi:application --preload" to tell heroku how to build the app.
    * ensure requirements.txt is up-to-date
    * ensure the local git is up-to-date
    * run "python manage.py collectstatic" to update AWS with any updated / new static files
    * install Heroku CLI on your gitpod instance "curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh"
    * run "heroku login -i" and enter your username and password for the app
    * once logged in run "git push heroku main" to push the git update to heroku and build the app

### Making a local copy (clone)
* Log into your github and browse [this repo](https://github.com/tomnaylor/ci-ms4-opera-rep)
* Under "<> Code" copy the link for the clone
* In bash, run "git clone URL_FROM_ABOVE". Your local clone should be created in the directory you're in
* If you're using chrome and the gitpod plugin you can simply click on "open in Gitpod" avaliable next to "<> Code"
* Again in bash, run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to install all the required packages

### Acknowledgements

The inspiration behind this website was based on recent work for an internation opera company, always looking to build their audience..

I'd like to give a big thank you to my mentor Caleb Mbakwe and family for their help and advice during developing this app.
